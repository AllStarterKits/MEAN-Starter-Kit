## Why this starter kit?
I created this starter kit for all of my MEAN-stack projects to save time on setting everything up. Because of this the workflow can be different from what you're used to, for example. You can of course change the the complete workflow to suit your needs. If you are looking for a custom boiler plate with other functionalities or whatever, of a more complete starter kit, check out [Mega Boiler Plate](http://megaboilerplate.com/), it's great!

## Installation
This starter kit requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run (duh).
```sh
$ npm install
```
```sh
$ npm nodemon
```
And in another terminal, run
```
$ ng serve
```


## Useful notes
Just a handful of useful notes I would recommend using when you work with this starter kit.
* Don't add any files into the ./dist folder. Always put them in the ./src folder.

## Features I am still working on (kind of a to do list for myself too)
* A way to merge the Angular `ng serve` and the Node `nodemon` commands in one terminal window
* Add browser sync for live styling updates
* A form that you can use
* Better styling, some more elements
* I might add some more pages, like about us, services, contact, etc.
* Maybe a login feature, although I am not sure yet about that
* Some sort of backend panel would be nice with a couple of options
* Mongoose integration
* I might add a blog function to the starter kit

## Licence
MIT - so use it whenever, whereever and however you want it :)
